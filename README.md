### What I Do

I design and build applied machine learning systems with a strong engineering focus:

• Model implementation and training (PyTorch, from scratch when needed)  
• Dataset handling, evaluation, and failure analysis  
• Inference optimization (latency, memory, throughput)  
• GPU and embedded deployments (Jetson, edge devices)  
• Reproducible and containerized ML workflows  

Currently Data Science Manager at ITJ Labs, contributing hands-on to ML system design and execution.
